# Olympic Perstige

The Olympic Games are global sports events where athletes from around the world compete in various sport competitions. Despite their popularity, hosting the Games incurs significant financial risks, with average costs exceeding $8.9 billion per event. A study by the University of Oxford's Said Business School found consistent cost overruns for hosting countries over the past 60 years, questioning the financial rationale behind hosting the Olympics.

This project, 'Olympic Prestige,' aims to investigate the perceived benefits of hosting the Olympics. One hypothesis is that hosting countries may gain a homebase advantage, leading to increased medal counts for their athletes. Additionally, the extensive data available on Olympic athletes, dating back to 1896, allows for an examination of physical factors such as age, height, and weight to identify trends and changes in Olympic sports.
